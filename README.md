Single-Host Static IPv4 Addressing & Local Loopback Verification

Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates how to configure a standalone workstation with a static IPv4 address in Cisco Packet Tracer and verify the network configuration using Command Prompt utilities.

The lab also verifies the local TCP/IP protocol stack and the assigned network interface using "ping".

Objectives

- Configure a static IPv4 address on PC0.
- Configure the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server.
- Verify the IP configuration using "ipconfig /all".
- Test the local TCP/IP protocol stack using the loopback address.
- Verify the assigned IPv4 address using "ping".

Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Command Prompt
- IPv4 Networking

Network Configuration

Parameter| Configuration
Device| PC0
Interface| FastEthernet0
IPv4 Address| "192.168.10.25"
Subnet Mask| "255.255.255.0"
CIDR| "/24"
Default Gateway| "192.168.10.1"
DNS Server| "8.8.8.8"

Configuration Steps

1. Add PC0

A generic PC was added from the End Devices section in Cisco Packet Tracer.

2. Configure Static IPv4

Navigate to:

PC0 → Desktop → IP Configuration → Static

Enter the following values:

IPv4 Address:    192.168.10.25
Subnet Mask:     255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1
DNS Server:      8.8.8.8

3. Verify IP Configuration

Open:

PC0 → Desktop → Command Prompt

Run:

ipconfig /all

The output should confirm that FastEthernet0 is configured with:

IPv4 Address: 192.168.10.25
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

4. Test the Local TCP/IP Stack

Run:

ping 127.0.0.1

The loopback address "127.0.0.1" is used to verify the local TCP/IP protocol stack.

5. Verify the Assigned IP Address

Run:

ping 192.168.10.25

A successful response confirms that the configured interface responds to its assigned IPv4 address.

Verification Results

Test| Expected Result| Status
Static IP Configuration| Correct IPv4 parameters| Passed
"ipconfig /all"| 192.168.10.25 / 255.255.255.0| Passed
"ping 127.0.0.1"| Reply received, 0% loss| Passed
"ping 192.168.10.25"| Reply received, 0% loss| Passed

Key Learning

This lab provided practical experience with:

- Static IPv4 addressing
- Subnet masks and "/24" networks
- Default gateway configuration
- DNS configuration
- "ipconfig /all"
- IPv4 loopback testing
- "ping" for connectivity verification
- Basic network troubleshooting using Cisco Packet Tracer

Conclusion

The standalone workstation PC0 was configured with the required static IPv4 parameters. The configuration was verified using "ipconfig /all", while loopback and host-address ping tests were used to verify the local TCP/IP stack and network interface configuration.
